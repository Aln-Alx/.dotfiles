# .dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. (or at least the ones I could be bothered to push to github). For a more descriptive list: Thunar - my primary file manager; fastfetch - the only neofetch equivalent I have on my device; ghostty - my terminal emulator of choice and arguably the best one; kitty - helps render stuff in said terminal; neovim - one of my editors and with a config I ~stole~ borrowed from BreadOnPenguins; rmpc - the terminal music player I really need to start customizing; xfe - the file explorer I barely use; zsh - the shell I use

## My Commit format:
---
This should be helpful for any outsiders trying to decipher my commit messages and also for me to make them at least seem consistent here it it is:
```[#CommitNum DAYOFWEEKACRONYMDDMMYY - ACTUALCOMMITMESSAGE ]```
(CommitNum - Is the counot of what commit it is; DAYOFWEEKACRONYM is yk M for Monday, SU for Sunday etc, ddmmyy is just the regular format for dates and ACTUALCOMMITMESSAGE is the commit message if you couldn't guess)
