# .dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. (or at least the ones I could be bothered to push to github). For a more descriptive list: fastfetch - the only neofetch equivalent I have on my device; ghostty - my terminal emulator of choice and arguably the best one; kitty - helps render stuff in said terminal; neovim - one of my editors and with a config I  that took a bit too much inspiration from [BreadOnPenguins](https://github.com/BreadOnPenguins); rmpc - the terminal music player I really need to start customizing; zsh - the shell I use

## My Commit format:
This should be helpful for any outsiders trying to decipher my commit messages and also for me to make them at least seem consistent here it it is:


```[#CommitNum DAYDDMMYY - COMMITMESSAGE ]```
